I am creating a mod for the game Rounds, introducing a lot of sweeping changes to the gameplay.

- Assets\_TeamComposition\Code\MyPlugin.cs is the main plugin for the mod. Hooks are added there that will run at different points throughout gameplay and setup
- You can always refer to source code in OtherMods/ to see how other mods are performing similar tasks. Some extra important mods:
	- UnboundLib is in there and is very important, it provides a lot of API scaffolding for all of the other mods.
	- RoundsWithFriends is a very key mod and is highly stable. The whole modding community exists because of this mod.
